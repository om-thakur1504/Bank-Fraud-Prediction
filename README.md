# Bank Fraud Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Bank fraud is a major financial threat that causes significant losses every year.  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict whether a bank transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate** based on transaction-related features.

The goal is to help financial institutions detect fraud early and reduce financial risk.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given a dataset of bank transactions, predict whether a transaction is fraudulent using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Fraud vs Non-Fraud classification  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains transaction-level data such as:
  - Transaction amount  
  - Account information  
  - Transaction type  
  - Labels indicating fraud or non-fraud  

> ⚠️ Due to privacy reasons, real banking data may be anonymized or simulated.

---

## 🧪 Model Used
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / Decision Tree (depending on implementation)
- Binary Classification:
  - `0` → Non-Fraud  
  - `1` → Fraud  

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics are especially important because fraud datasets are often **highly imbalanced**.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/om-thakur1504/Bank-Fraud-Prediction.git
cd Bank-Fraud-Prediction
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the main `.ipynb` file step by step.

---

## 📌 Results

The model successfully identifies fraudulent transactions with reasonable accuracy and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in fraud detection scenarios.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or advanced sampling
* Try advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks
* Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI
* Real-time fraud detection system
