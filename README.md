# Bank Fraud Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Bank fraud is a major financial threat that causes significant losses every year.
This project aims to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a bank transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate** based on transaction-related features.

The system helps financial institutions detect fraud early and minimize financial risk.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given historical bank transaction data, develop a supervised machine learning model to classify transactions as:

* **Fraudulent**
* **Non-Fraudulent**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model training and testing
* Fraud detection using classification algorithms

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of transaction-level banking data, which may include:

* Transaction amount
* Account details
* Transaction type
* Fraud label

> Note: The dataset may be anonymized or synthetically generated to preserve privacy.

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models

The project may use one or more of the following models:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

**Target Variable:**

* `0` → Non-Fraud
* `1` → Fraud

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

These metrics are crucial due to the **imbalanced nature** of fraud datasets.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/om-thakur1504/Bank-Fraud-Prediction.git
cd Bank-Fraud-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook and execute the main notebook file step by step.

## 📌 Results

The trained model is capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with satisfactory performance, demonstrating the usefulness of machine learning in banking fraud detection.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Address class imbalance using SMOTE or other resampling techniques
* Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks
* Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI
* Implement real-time fraud detection
